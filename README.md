# Part2
For Part 2 Step 3, the output I obtained was a synchronization of A, B, and C. I am satisfied with this
output because in my previous experiences when working with threads, I have seen patterns of repeated characters.
For step 5, the initial output was repeated Cs. But I modified the program by moving printC("C") after the 
initialization of the 2 threads so that A, B, and C can be printed.
